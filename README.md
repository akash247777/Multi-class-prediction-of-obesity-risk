# üè• Multi-class Prediction of Obesity Risk üè•

## Overview
The "Multi-Class Prediction of Obesity Risk" project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify individuals into various risk categories for obesity based on a set of input features. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to provide insights into obesity risk and helps in taking preventive measures.

## üéØ Objectives
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Gather and clean a comprehensive dataset containing relevant features such as demographic information, lifestyle factors, medical history, and dietary habits.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Identify and create meaningful features that can improve the model's predictive performance.
3. **Model Development:** Build and train a multi-class classification model using various machine learning algorithms.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and techniques to ensure accuracy and reliability.
5. **Deployment:** Develop a user-friendly application or tool that allows users to input data and receive predictions on obesity risk categories.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** Collect data from reliable sources, including medical records, surveys, and publicly available datasets. Ensure the data is diverse and representative of different populations.
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Normalize or standardize numerical features.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and relationships between features.
   - Select or create features that have a strong correlation with obesity risk.
4. **Model Development:**
   - Experiment with various machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks.
   - Use techniques like cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC for multi-class classification.
   - Analyze confusion matrices to understand misclassifications and improve the model.
6. **Deployment:**
   - Develop an interactive web application or mobile app that takes user input and provides obesity risk predictions.
   - Ensure the application is intuitive and provides actionable insights based on the predictions.

## üåü Expected Outcomes
- A robust and accurate multi-class classification model capable of predicting obesity risk.
- An interactive tool that aids healthcare professionals and individuals in identifying obesity risk and implementing preventive measures.
- Improved understanding of the key factors contributing to obesity, facilitating better health policies and interventions.
